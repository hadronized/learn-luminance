# Learn luminance

The `luminance` ecosystem is currently going under a heavy relifting — as of _Wed Mar 8 2023_, so is this book.

If you really want to follow the development, you can hop on 
[phaazon/luminance-rs](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs).

Also, the old book’s examples are still available here:

1. [Chapter 1](https://github.com/phaazon/learn-luminance/tree/master/examples/chapter-1).
2. [Chapter 2](https://github.com/phaazon/learn-luminance/tree/master/examples/chapter-2).
3. [Chapter 3](https://github.com/phaazon/learn-luminance/tree/master/examples/chapter-3).
